The information regarding Charles Babbage is something that caught my interest. From the lecture, it was stated he created the plans for the Difference Engine, a precursor for the computer.In the mid-1830s Babbage developed the plans for the Analytical Engine a forerunner to the modern digital computer. This steam-powered Analytical device could calculate and perform mathematical algorithms based on instruction through punch cards. Unfortunately, Babbage didn&rsquo;t live to see his creations become a reality, but they helped begin the technological age. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">History of the Internet-Video Two</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In this video mnemonics were discussed as well as how the technology was used with the development. Part of this brought to mind the 2016 film Hidden Figures. A film based on a biography of the same name about three women of color who were influential in the 1960&rsquo;s space race. It&rsquo;s only in recent years that the story of these women has been brought to American History. In the 1950&rsquo;s women were hired by NASA to perform computations. One of the three women, Dorothy Vaughan, learned NASA was going to replace the human computers with digital machines. So Vaughan taught herself the FORTRAN computer language and taught it to her coworkers to prepare them for the transition. This helped boost her to the role of Nasa&rsquo;s first African-American supervisor. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">History of the Internet-Video Three</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In this video, we learned how the World Wide Web as we know it was created and how popular it has become over the years. This concept was first developed by a British Cern Researcher known as Tim Berners-lee and is believed to have been inspired into creating it by a Victorian Era &lsquo;How To&rsquo; book.
